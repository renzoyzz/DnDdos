![Map of Phandalin](./phandalin.JPG)

The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstonefoundations.
More old ruins-crumbling stone walls coveredin ivy and briars-surround the newer houses and shops,
showing how this must have been a much larger town incenturies past. Most of the newer buildings
are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy mainstreet of sorts as it climbs
toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town. As you approach, you see children
playing on the town greenand townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people
look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.
